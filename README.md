# PyScripts
Contains simple short python scripts which may be useful in daily life
------------------------------
clipboard.py :
1. make it executable using
    chmod +x clipboard.py
2. move it to /usr/local/bin so that it is available to all users
    sudo mv clipboard.py /usr/local/bin/

for ease of use , I suggest the file be renamed to something short, like cp or copy :
    cd /usr/local/bin
    sudo mv clipboard.py cp

USAGE :

Tada! Now you can use this script from practically any directory
command:
(assuming u have renamed it to cp)
 cp  file_to_be_copied.txt

The contents of the file will be copied to the clipboard
